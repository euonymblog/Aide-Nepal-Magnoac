Following the devastating earthquakes in Nepal in 2015 we set about raising money to rebuild a school in Taruka, a poor farming village, in the middle hills. This is an area seldom visited by tourists, in fact, our founder Roy was one of the first outsiders to visit the region. Having re-build and furnished the village school we now hope to fund a roving health worker, a district nurse on a motor bike. The roads are almost non-existent!
